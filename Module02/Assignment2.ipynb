    "The dataset consists of two separate datasets that we will combine to create a new combined dataset. One dataset contains red wine samples and the other contains white\n",
    "wine samples. Each sample consists of several physicochemical features (e.g., pH, alcohol content) and a quality rating between 0 and 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use pandas to load both datasets into separate DataFrames. \n",
    "2. Add a new column to each DataFrame to identify the wine type: red or white. \n",
    "    - For example, add a column named wineType with a value of \"red\" to the red wine DataFrame, \n",
    "    - and add a column named wineType with a value of \"white\" to the white wine DataFrame.\n",
    "3. Concatenate the two DataFrames into a single DataFrame using the pandas. \n",
    "    - Make sure to set the ignore index parameter to True to reset the index of the combined DataFrame. \n",
    "4. You now have a single DataFrame containing both the red and white wine datasets combined"
